    "# Conclusion & Reflection\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Despite well-developed countries across the world investing in public surveillance technology to combat crime, there is little evidence that these technologies actually correlate with less crime. Even though it could be a useful tool for post-scenery crime detection, it does not tackle the structural issue of global inequalities causing crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "As various HDI-measures seem to predict crime rates, this seems to suggest that investing in satisfactory life prospects, high quality education, and stability of income could reduce crime rates across the world. This way, surveillance cameras might even lose their policy-imposed meaning within civil and criminal discourse.\n",

    "## Reflection\n",
    "**Feedback opportunity 1 (proposal), 13-06-2024:** <br>\n",
    "Our TA gave us a summary of some questions he had about our proposal, which had 2 points that stood out: Whether we wanted to focus on cities or countries and how we would deal with not all the data originating from the same year. After receiving the feedback, we decided to aim for analyzing the problem per country, as well as making an argument that using data from different years wouldn’t be a problem, as we would be predicting crime rates retroactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feedback opportunity 2 (draft, 20-6-2024):** <br>\n",
    "Our TA gave us some feedback on points that needed elaboration, which included: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Variable descriptions need to be structured in a clearer manner\n",
    "* Make titles of visualizations more precise and exact\n",
    "* Put more nuance in some of the arguments we made\n",
    "* Integrate the visualizations more in the overall story and connect certain arguments with each other.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "We used this feedback to improve our story to the best of our abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Peer feedback (draft, 25-06-2024):** <br>\n",
    "After the presentation of our draft to our TA and another project group, we received the following feedback:\n",
    "* The scatterplot that displays crime and law enforcement should use an extra legend.\n",
    "* Our TA asked if the first visualization would be more clear if we were to use a logarithmic scale, but this was dismissed, as a linear scale would more intuitively illustrate the point of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Work distribution\n",
    "Every team member has been involved in writing parts of the story and creating some of the graphs. We primarily communicated during meetings on campus and additionally over online texting. Below, the work distribution will be explained in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Lisa van Oosten:* <br>\n",
    "This member was responsible for the general writing of the story and story structure and finding datasets, as well as coming up with ideas to visualize and support our arguments in a meaningful way. Lisa also helped with the making of some visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Jesse van Bakel:* <br>\n",
    "This member was responsible for the more technical part of the project, like creating some graphs and integrating them into the Jupyter Book. Jesse would make the group’s ideas come to life in precise and clear visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Jack de Boer:* <br>\n",
    "This member was mainly responsible for seeking correlations between variables, and to make sure the visualizations would come out meaningful if they were to be made. Jack also helped with the making of some visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hajar Benmimoun:* <br>\n",
    "This member was responsible for making some visualizations and discussing with Lisa what the best options would be for the story. Hajar made great use of her sharp mind to discuss and communicate with the other members, which greatly benefited parts for our project."
