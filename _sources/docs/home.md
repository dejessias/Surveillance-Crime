# Introduction

In recent decades, the implementation of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) to combat crime has gained prevalence (Pavone & Esposti, 2012). Framed by security authorities as a cost-efficient tool, it has become one of the fastest-growing security practices. (Ezzat et al., 2021). Densely populated urban areas have become hubs for extensive surveillance, with some cities deploying nearly half a million cameras each (McCall et al., 2021).

On the other hand, the effectiveness of CCTV as crime prevention remains debatable. While criminal activity is influenced by human developmental factors, the question of whether crime prevention should rely upon technological tools or be addressed as a socio-structural issue can be forwarded (Pavone & Esposti, 2012).

Using CCTV as a case study, this data story explores how technologies are promoted as temporary fixes to address surface-level issues, symbols of wealth and power, and what they secretly reveal about the governments and societies that implement them.
